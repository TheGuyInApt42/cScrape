I am making a brand new mobile app called 'Weight Wager'. This app is not out yet but I hope to launch it in late Fall and it is nearly complete. I am looking for about 20-30 mobile testers to install the app and play the game in mid-August (prior to it launching to the general public). \nIMPORTANT: To participate, you must reply to this email and answer ALL 11 questions below.\nWhat is Weight Wager?\nWeight Wager is the First Live, National, Smart-Scale Weight Loss Game Show.\nImagine, each morning, thousands of American weight loss competitors stepping onto their wireless smart-scales as they sync their weight loss data into a national, real-time Weight Loss Leader-board.\nUsers who lose weight weekly, win a cash prize share between $10 - $250. Users who gain weight weekly, pay those cash prizes. The prize announcements are hosted as a 'Money Monday' party weekly via an in-app live video-cast from a group of witty, entertaining, and inspirational Weight Loss, Fitness and Nutrition Coaches.\nHere is the website for the app to give you more of a feel, if you want to be a mobile tester and do the game! \nhttps://www.WeightWagerApp.com/\nWho I am looking for in YOU to test the app (minimum qualifications to participate):\n1. Do you live in the United States? Are you a U.S. Citizen? What City and State? Do you have a piece of mail that you can prove that you can take a quick picture of to prove that you live in the U.S.? (not necessary to send now).\n2. Are you pregnant or anticipate being pregnant during the game? (We do not allow anyone who is pregnant to participate in Weight Wager - to ensure proper health for the baby). \n3. What is your age? \n4. Do you own either an Android phone or an iPhone? If so, what exact Model is it? (iphone 8, Samsung Galaxy 9 etc) It is very important that you answer this question in detail as this is a mobile app and I need to know how it will work on your phone in advance...). Each phone works differently and is a factor in usability and experience.\n5. Are you trying to lose weight at all? If so, how many pounds? Approximate.\n6. Do you own a normal scale or a smart-scale? If a smart scale, can you specify the brand of the smart-scale?\n7. Do you have a Paypal account? If you do not, you would have to sign up to Paypal to participate (this is how you get paid when you go down in weight OR pay when you go up in weight)...\n8. Could you use the app daily and weigh in - inside the app for 28 days straight? And especially on Mondays ('Money Mondays' are the days that your weigh in counts for money. Either you win money on Mondays or you have to pay out money on Mondays (if you went up in weight from week to week)...\n9. Are you willing to bet $10 per week for 4 weeks? If you go up in weight \u2013 the app will charge your paypal account that every Monday. If you go down in weight, you pay nothing and win a share of money from the other players in the game, who went up on Monday and paid. \n10. Are you willing to fill out a 25 question survey about Weight Wager and all of the signup screens, marketing screens, onboarding screens and weigh in screens? We will provide the questions - we need to know about your experience with the usability (ease of using the app or not easy to use) and the features (did you understand how to use the app - were there features that could be improved? Were there errors or features that literally did not work etc). \n11. What is your direct email address and full name? \n(once you provide this \u2013 I will contact you for when the game will start \u2013 it is estimated that it will launch in mid-August but that date could delay as the app is still in development\u2026\nPlease respond to this email with all 11 answers and/or let me know if you have any questions. \nThank you\nAndrew\nCEO of Weight Wager Inc.\nhttp://www.WeightWagerApp.com\n571.234.2100    \n", "city": "raleigh / durham / CH", "post_date": "2019-07-28 16:31", "insert_date": "\"2019-08-24T01:22:35.623978\""}, "7": {"c_id": "6951028230", "post_title": "Laravel App Help Needed", "description": "Looking for an experienced Laravel developer for freelance work on an as-needed basis.

We have been increasing our usage of GitLab for both project management and source control. \nI would like to take this to the next level and deploy an internally managed instance of Gitlab Enterprise (I would opt for cloud offering but the pricing is more advantageous for self-hosted).\nOne of the key objectives I want to be able to accomplish here this project is automated deployment of review apps as well as automated testing to ensure he changes about to be committed don't break anything.\nA few things about our work:\n- Heavy user of AWS platform services (like RDS, Elasticsearch Service, S3, Cognito, API Gateway, Lambda etc...)\n- Backend components are almost exclusively built in Python. Exceptions to this would be cases where we are relying on non-Python based platforms, such as Elasticsearch. \n- Frontend components are almost exclusively built as React webapps. \nBefore shifting work to Gitlab, we experimented with using AWS Codestar (which has fully managed build service, automated continuous delivery and deployments, etc...). It was extremely useful to be able to commit code and have that automatically kickoff a deployment so we could examine the changes from within the context of the application.\nFor the scope of this project, I would like your help with the following:\n- Installation and configuration of Gitlab Enterprise on AWS, Including any integration required to enable automated deployments. This would include configuration of the AWS kubernetes service, etc...\n- Guidance on how to best handle projects with heavy AWS dependencies - for example, would deploying a review app standup an entirely separate environment via CloudFormation? Or would we have dev/test/prod AWS assets setup ahead of time that the review apps would depend on (for example, if we were building an app atop the AWS Elasticsearch service).\n- Guidance on how we can build application templates that may facilitate the process of beginning work on a new project. For example, CodeStar had several project templates to choose from (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codestar/latest/userguide/templates.html). \n- Any other expertise you can provide to help our team move through projects in a more efficient manner (across project management, development, testing, deployment, etc...).\nIn order to be considered for this project, you must have experience with Gitlab in an enterprise environment working on agile projects. Please mention specific experience in your responses - it will help me identify you as someone I should talk to as part of the selection process.\n:-)    \n", "city": "new york city", "post_date": "2019-07-31 03:43", "insert_date": "\"2019-08-24T01:24:47.729553\""}, "25": {"c_id": "6961042014", "post_title": "Meditation App User Testing This Week 30min - $20", "description": "We are seeking participants to test our Mindfulness iOS app.\nWe are seeking participants between 25-42 years old that are practicing meditation, or have done meditation in the past.

I am making a brand new mobile app called 'Weight Wager'. This app is not out yet but I hope to launch it in late Fall and it is nearly complete. I am looking for about 20-30 mobile testers to install the app and play the game in mid-August (prior to it launching to the general public). \nIMPORTANT: To participate, you must reply to this email and answer ALL 11 questions below.\nWhat is Weight Wager?\nWeight Wager is the First Live, National, Smart-Scale Weight Loss Game Show.\nImagine, each morning, thousands of American weight loss competitors stepping onto their wireless smart-scales as they sync their weight loss data into a national, real-time Weight Loss Leader-board.\nUsers who lose weight weekly, win a cash prize share between $10 - $250. Users who gain weight weekly, pay those cash prizes. The prize announcements are hosted as a 'Money Monday' party weekly via an in-app live video-cast from a group of witty, entertaining, and inspirational Weight Loss, Fitness and Nutrition Coaches.\nHere is the website for the app to give you more of a feel, if you want to be a mobile tester and do the game! \nhttps://www.WeightWagerApp.com/\nWho I am looking for in YOU to test the app (minimum qualifications to participate):\n1. Do you live in the United States? Are you a U.S. Citizen? What City and State? Do you have a piece of mail that you can prove that you can take a quick picture of to prove that you live in the U.S.? (not necessary to send now).\n2. Are you pregnant or anticipate being pregnant during the game? (We do not allow anyone who is pregnant to participate in Weight Wager - to ensure proper health for the baby). \n3. What is your age? \n4. Do you own either an Android phone or an iPhone? If so, what exact Model is it? (iphone 8, Samsung Galaxy 9 etc) It is very important that you answer this question in detail as this is a mobile app and I need to know how it will work on your phone in advance...). Each phone works differently and is a factor in usability and experience.\n5. Are you trying to lose weight at all? If so, how many pounds? Approximate.\n6. Do you own a normal scale or a smart-scale? If a smart scale, can you specify the brand of the smart-scale?\n7. Do you have a Paypal account? If you do not, you would have to sign up to Paypal to participate (this is how you get paid when you go down in weight OR pay when you go up in weight)...\n8. Could you use the app daily and weigh in - inside the app for 28 days straight? And especially on Mondays ('Money Mondays' are the days that your weigh in counts for money. Either you win money on Mondays or you have to pay out money on Mondays (if you went up in weight from week to week)...\n9. Are you willing to bet $10 per week for 4 weeks? If you go up in weight \u2013 the app will charge your paypal account that every Monday. If you go down in weight, you pay nothing and win a share of money from the other players in the game, who went up on Monday and paid. \n10. Are you willing to fill out a 25 question survey about Weight Wager and all of the signup screens, marketing screens, onboarding screens and weigh in screens? We will provide the questions - we need to know about your experience with the usability (ease of using the app or not easy to use) and the features (did you understand how to use the app - were there features that could be improved? Were there errors or features that literally did not work etc). \n11. What is your direct email address and full name? \n(once you provide this \u2013 I will contact you for when the game will start \u2013 it is estimated that it will launch in mid-August but that date could delay as the app is still in development\u2026\nPlease respond to this email with all 11 answers and/or let me know if you have any questions. \nThank you\nAndrew\nCEO of Weight Wager Inc.\nhttp://www.WeightWagerApp.com\n571.234.2100    \n", "city": "portland", "post_date": "2019-07-26 11:22", "insert_date": "\"2019-08-24T01:31:35.942763\""}, "28": {"c_id": "6960340302", "post_title": "Get 10-15% Commission for Bringing Web Design Clients/Projects", "description": "I own a creative agency doing graphic and web design.\nIf you find clients that need any creative design or development services, I will give you 10-15% of everything I make with them during an entire year since the introduction. \nMost of my projects range from $3000 to $30,000.\nServices I provide:\n+ Logo Design\n+ Printing\n+ Editorial Design\n+ Web Design\n+ Web Development\n+ iOS & Android App Development\n+ E-Commerce Solutions    \n", "city": "portland", "post_date": "2019-08-19 16:34", "insert_date": "\"2019-08-24T01:31:46.222416\""}, "29": {"c_id": "6948350435", "post_title": "Need Help with Laser Engraving", "description": "I am very familiar with computers but have never bought or used a Laser Engraver\nI'm thinking of getting a Glowforge since it seems to be user friendly and has a lot of potential\nBut primarily what I need an engraver for is a very specialized function, so I may start with a less expensive engraver to start with - maybe, maybe not - not sure just yet \nHowever - \nI am a bookbinder and I have seen several YouTube videos of people using a laser engraver to essentially \"burn\" laser foil into various mediums such as wood and acrylic\nif you're familiar with hard cover books, many of them have a technique called Foil Embossing imprinted into the cover and spine\nThis can be simple text, or elaborate designs - I need both for what I need to do - \nThe \"old-school\" or traditional method for doing this is quite complicated and very expensive\nI've seen Chinese made \"Digital Foil Embossing Machines\" but these run around $4500 - which of course if I'm going to spend that much, may as well buy a Glowforge and have much more functionality\nBut I've also seen \"Chinese Made\" Laser Engravers being sold on eBay, Amazon - even Walmart for around $350-$450 that are around 40 watts (same as a standard GlowForge - and I've also seen 3 watt (or 3000 milliwatt) laser engravers going for around $125-$175\nSo the point to all this is - I have no experience with Laser Engravers at all - and would like to find someone who has experience with them that can advise me on which one I need to buy, and once I do so - can get me started on basic operation - specifically on doing the Laser Foil \"Embossing\" into hard cover books that I will be making from scratch, or at very least - have printed for me \nI don't know what to offer someone for this - I don't know how much time you will need to spend to get me up and running\nAs I mentioned, I have many years experience working with computers, in fact I used to be a Desktop Admin/Network Support Operator\nBut, I don't have any experience with Laser Engravers, or the software used to operate them\nFurther - I don't have much experience with apps like PhotoShop or any other Illustrator apps or of that type\nI'm an old school craftsperson and computer geek who has aims at being a \"maker - I plan on getting a 3D printer and CNC machine eventually, but the laser engraver is what I need first and basically I need someone with experience with them that can get me off the ground and moving quickly\nI learn much quicker if I have someone simply show me, than trying to read website blogs or manuals\nThis is why I am wanting to hire someone to help me get started\nSo...I hope all that made sense\nIf you have experience with Laser Engravers and believe you can help me get started with what I am trying to do - please contact me\nWe can talk about compensation, but I figured either an hourly rate, or perhaps a per session.\nI learn quick so I should pick it up pretty fast\nOh, and if you're familiar/experienced with Laser Engravers, but not necessarily with the task I am describing, I can share the YouTube videos I mentioned to help that process along\nEmail me if you can help, and/or if you have questions\nThanks in advance\nJake    \n", "city": "portland", "post_date": "2019-08-02 18:54", "insert_date": "\"2019-08-24T01:31:51.376320\""}, "30": {"c_id": "6961880529", "post_title": "Make a quick $10 sending Facebook event invites", "description": "We could use help promoting a public costume party Facebook event.

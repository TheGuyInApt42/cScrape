If you are brand new, this is not for you.  I am looking for a partner to day-trade forex markets during the American business hours starting at 8am.  I would trade from 9pm Asia, through Europe till 8am and pass the account to you and give you a written briefing.  I have a profitable unique quantitative strategy, with more details below.  \nYou\u2019d be kicking in your own money into an account with my money and we\u2019d split the profit.  I need a partner because I cannot handle the long hours by myself.   Below is information about me, the strategy, and what would be required of you.\nWhat would be required of you\nThis assumes you are passionate about Global Macro and forex.  If you\u2019re not already interested in being a trader, this isn\u2019t going to work.  I am also expecting you\u2019ve traded forex before for at least a few months, and are familiar with a lot the basics.\nYou can expect to make 10-20% on money you put into an account that we share.  Right now, I aim to make $150-200 per day, with a couple of days of having to sit out.  On a sit out day, you\u2019d have to do nothing.\nI am looking for a partner in the New York City/Tri-state area.  I live in New Jersey right across the George Washington bridge and I would have to meet you.  We would have to trust each other because you\u2019d have access to my account and my P&L would reflect your decisions.\nHours\nYou\u2019d be required to work 8am to 11am and occasionally in the afternoon as well if it\u2019s a busy day. \nThe trading day is broken up into 4 sections:\n-Asian (9pm \u2013 2am) \u2013  I\u2019d handle this\n-European (2am to 8am) \u2013  I\u2019d handle this\n-American morning (8am to 11am)  - You\n-American afternoon (11am to 4pm) \u2013 Sometimes You, Usually Nothing and we sit out\nAbout Me\nI question the structure of our economic system and don\u2019t agree with a monetary system based on debt.  This view of  fractional reserve banking would be classified as Austrian economics but I\u2019ve added many of my own ideas upon the existing framework of Austrian authors.  My photo next to my economics reading is on this post  and you can find my writings at GlobalMacroForex.com\nI\u2019ve been trading spot forex and equity indexes for 2 years with live money, but reading a lot before.  My focus is on G7 Western Europe, America, Japan, and China.\nAbout the Strategy\nThis is not technical analysis.  And it\u2019s not fundamental, if you define fundamentals as government numbers or information from the news.  Instead, I have unique perspective on what drives markets and essentially, I am trading bank liquidity.  Nobody trades like me, so it\u2019s hard to label it for you.\nMy \u201cformulas\u201d or ideas are ways of assessing bank supply, demand, and cycles.  Utilizing data scrapped off the internet and publicly available data from both government and private sources, my strategies give a view into the most probable scenarios on a 1-3 day timeframe.  It\u2019s not a single data point, but a combination of objective formulas and ideas that mean certain outcomes.\nThis strategy combines some elements of rules based systematic thinking with discretionary implementation.  Each trade has an objective pre-defined minimum requirements, but which of the many trade choices that met the minimum or how long the trade is held is discretionary.\n", "city": "new york city", "post_date": "2019-08-24 01:14", "insert_date": "\"2019-08-28T12:45:01.873439\""}, "5": {"c_id": "6963061347", "post_title": "Coding & Programming Help- Basic 101 (TUTOR)", "description": "Looking for tutor to help with basic Java programming .Syntax, Objects, variables, arrays, data types, operators, and control flow.

I\u2019ve been trying to get it to rank on the first page for the obvious keyword (I need help with SEO but that is another GIG). It has a few pages of relevant content but I really want it to have one simple fun and easy feature to make it takeoff. I\u2019ve recently paid to have the theme updated but I am not satisfied with it and also found out that the site speed sucks. I\u2019ve had a game created years ago that is embedded onto the site and that is what I would like to focus on bringing front and center. \nMy vision is to have something fun, simple and useful on the homepage. Some of the most successful, liked, shared and visited things are SIMPLE. Meaning the visitor goes to the website and they encounter ONE main thing that they interact with and share because it was relevant to the topic and served its purpose. I\u2019m thinking a lightweight game or visually appealing quiz. Something that is a step up from the quizzes/puzzles that you can embed into a website. So I need someone to upgrade and improve the current game, make something similar but better and feature it front and center on the homepage. Most important it must help the visitor learn and remember what the 3 branches of government are. I want to put out something that actually has a positive impact on the people that use it. \nI had something created years ago but not sure how well it\u2019s functioning on all devices. It can and should be utilized or upgraded and put on the homepage if you feel that is the best and most cost effective solution. The game is here: http://3branchesofgovernment.com/quiz/\nI would like a way to either capture visitor emails after they take the quiz or play the game. Maybe require their email to find out their score or to be entered into a free monthly raffle of all the winners. I can possibly give a flag or copy of constitution away each month. Other option would provide the visitors their score, grade or a digital certificate so that they can share on it on whatever social platforms they may be using. But again...this all needs to be simple for the visitor...think EASY!   \nTRUMP: I rather not bash Trump because I want teachers to be able to share and use the website in schools so it must remain neutral. If anything I was thinking of using something like \u201cCan you name the three branches of government? Find out if you are stable genius! Play the 3 Branches Game!\u201d Because he referred to himself as a stable genius. We can also have an icon created of him as he explores or helps people learn about the 3 branches through the game. But remember the game needs to be quick and easy...just one level. If it works, then it can be expanded in the future because I don\u2019t have the funds for something complex. \nConstitution day is September 17th, 2019 and I feel this would be a good day to have the site refreshed (again) and shared with some sort of cute/fun/interesting/simple game or quiz that is on the homepage. So the deadline to do this is a little over two weeks. There is a yearly survey conducted around the same time and only 32% of Americans can name the 3 branches of government. I would like the idea to be response or tied into that statistic and ready for Constitution day. I am not looking for an intensive...heavy and complex website. I want it to be a website that other developers or designers go to and think...wow why didn\u2019t I think of that? Do you have a long term vision and ideas? Then let me know and maybe we can figure a way to keep the site improving and expanding on a monthly basis. \nPlease be interested in what I explained to you and know what you are doing. I\u2019m looking for someone that \u201cgets it\u201d and can make my idea into a reality within the timeframe without putting me in debt or you having to slave away for hours in front of the computer working on something complex and frustrating. I would like to hire someone that enjoys what they do, has the talent to deliver on my request and is more interested in seeing something created that is well received...becomes a hit and take credit for it. I\u2019m not looking for someone that wants to make a quick buck off delivering another \u201ctask\u201d. If you are really good and help me with this then you would be hired again and also recommended. I\u2019m just frustrated with hiring folks and getting bland results. I am a one person broke entrepreneur working a day job so I do not have a large budget so keep that in mind when you send me an estimate. I don\u2019t expect you to work for free and you will be paid whatever price is agreed upon. \nAny illustrations and written content can be provided. I do not want to use stock photos. If you are able to provide customized graphics or know someone that would be a match for this project you can let me know. \nSummary: This is a wordpress website focused on civics. It needs a revamp that can be ready by or before Sept 17th. I would like an interactive quiz or game that is SIMPLE yet stunning on the homepage. It must be website based, lightweight and function on all devices. The new concept must either capture emails and/or provide the ability to share the results of the participants. I would like it to have the best and easiest solution for visitors to leave comments and have a running conversations of the comments under it like you would find on popular news or gossip sites. The current articles and everything else can be minimized so the new feature shines. Only after the site takes off and has the trust of the visitors would I add ads so I can possibly start making back all the money I\u2019ve put into it. The goal is to create something useful related to the topic. \nIf you\u2019ve read this for and interested...\n-Do not copy and paste responses and resumes that you send to everyone else. \n-Give me your thoughts and ideas on my request.\n-Point me to a few things you created so I can see your capabilities. \n-Provide me your solution(s) that you have in mind and the approximate cost.\n-Ask me questions if you need clarification on something. \n-Let me know why you want to work on this.  \nI\u2019m sorry about the long rant but I\u2019ve been pumping money and time into this idea for years, I want it to work but also want it to be useful. I\u2019m not crazy and actually easy to work with. I just want to find someone that understands my vision and my current situation. I cannot and will not respond to every proposal. I will respond to those I am interested in working with.

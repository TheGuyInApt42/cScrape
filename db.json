If you are brand new, this is not for you.  I am looking for a partner to day-trade forex markets during the American business hours starting at 8am.  I would trade from 9pm Asia, through Europe till 8am and pass the account to you and give you a written briefing.  I have a profitable unique quantitative strategy, with more details below.  \nYou\u2019d be kicking in your own money into an account with my money and we\u2019d split the profit.  I need a partner because I cannot handle the long hours by myself.   Below is information about me, the strategy, and what would be required of you.\nWhat would be required of you\nThis assumes you are passionate about Global Macro and forex.  If you\u2019re not already interested in being a trader, this isn\u2019t going to work.  I am also expecting you\u2019ve traded forex before for at least a few months, and are familiar with a lot the basics.\nYou can expect to make 10-20% on money you put into an account that we share.  Right now, I aim to make $150-200 per day, with a couple of days of having to sit out.  On a sit out day, you\u2019d have to do nothing.\nI am looking for a partner in the New York City/Tri-state area.  I live in New Jersey right across the George Washington bridge and I would have to meet you.  We would have to trust each other because you\u2019d have access to my account and my P&L would reflect your decisions.\nHours\nYou\u2019d be required to work 8am to 11am and occasionally in the afternoon as well if it\u2019s a busy day. \nThe trading day is broken up into 4 sections:\n-Asian (9pm \u2013 2am) \u2013  I\u2019d handle this\n-European (2am to 8am) \u2013  I\u2019d handle this\n-American morning (8am to 11am)  - You\n-American afternoon (11am to 4pm) \u2013 Sometimes You, Usually Nothing and we sit out\nAbout Me\nI question the structure of our economic system and don\u2019t agree with a monetary system based on debt.  This view of  fractional reserve banking would be classified as Austrian economics but I\u2019ve added many of my own ideas upon the existing framework of Austrian authors.  My photo next to my economics reading is on this post  and you can find my writings at GlobalMacroForex.com\nI\u2019ve been trading spot forex and equity indexes for 2 years with live money, but reading a lot before.  My focus is on G7 Western Europe, America, Japan, and China.\nAbout the Strategy\nThis is not technical analysis.  And it\u2019s not fundamental, if you define fundamentals as government numbers or information from the news.  Instead, I have unique perspective on what drives markets and essentially, I am trading bank liquidity.  Nobody trades like me, so it\u2019s hard to label it for you.\nMy \u201cformulas\u201d or ideas are ways of assessing bank supply, demand, and cycles.  Utilizing data scrapped off the internet and publicly available data from both government and private sources, my strategies give a view into the most probable scenarios on a 1-3 day timeframe.  It\u2019s not a single data point, but a combination of objective formulas and ideas that mean certain outcomes.\nThis strategy combines some elements of rules based systematic thinking with discretionary implementation.  Each trade has an objective pre-defined minimum requirements, but which of the many trade choices that met the minimum or how long the trade is held is discretionary.\n", "city": "new york city", "post_date": "2019-08-24 01:14", "insert_date": "\"2019-08-28T12:45:01.873439\""}, "5": {"c_id": "6963061347", "post_title": "Coding & Programming Help- Basic 101 (TUTOR)", "description": "Looking for tutor to help with basic Java programming .Syntax, Objects, variables, arrays, data types, operators, and control flow.

Optimized. Responsive. etc. Custom/from scratch experience. Wordpress experience.\nLooking for someone proficient in programming. PHP/MySQL. Jquery. Json. Etc. Custom/from scratch experience. Wordpress experience.\nMust have experience and access to Adobe CC.\nThis is a remote based situation, so good online communication skills and availability are needed to make sure things stay on track throughout the project life cycle, etc. Email, Slack, Skype, etc.\nRate will depend upon level of experience and proficiency, and the type of work.\nThis is an opportunity to work with a seasoned senior level marketing professional on a range of projects. To collaborate, experiment, develop custom solutions. Grow in your skillsets and marketability while making some money. And hopefully to develop an ongoing working relationship that is mutually beneficial.\nHad to step down for almost 2 years due to a health scare. Now i am rebuilding. Lots of industry contacts, etc. Work is starting to flow again, and i could use some assistance.\nFluency of work, in the beginning may be a little touch and go until some momentum is generated. So this would be best suited for someone looking to supplement their current income or for a freelancer who already has some work of their own and are looking to add some new projects and experience to their portfolio.\nBest way to contact me to get things started would be email. A copy of a resume and portfolio of some work would be necessary.\nUPDATE: Thank you to those who have submitted responses. I am working my way through the responses, but will be running this ad to the end of its duration (which should be another week or two), at that time i will begin responding.
